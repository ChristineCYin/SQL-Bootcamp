# SQL-Bootcamp

Great course, I learned how to use SQL to query databases and perform data analysis. I know how to use logical operators to add logic flows to SQL queries, common SQL JOIN commands and perform aggregate functions, and advanced SQL commands such as extracts and subqueries, as well as create databases and tables.
