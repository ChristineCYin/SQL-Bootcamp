NOTE: BETWEEN need to be careful when using for date: because sometime it will as exclusive or inclusive depending on the system and how it thinks of the end of a day whether a day starts at zero hundred hours or ends at twenty four hundred. That could cause some confusion with the between operator and often for the end date you have to go one day further into the future.
The better way:
WHERE starttime >= '2012-09-01' AND starttime < '2012-10-1'
